# Flight Deal Tracker ✈️

A Python-based flight deal tracker that automatically monitors airfare prices from a fixed origin city to multiple destinations. It integrates with the Amadeus API to fetch real-time flight offers, stores and updates data in a Google Sheet via Sheety API, and sends SMS alerts using Twilio when cheaper deals are found.

## Key Features

- Real-time flight price monitoring using Amadeus API  
- Google Sheets integration for storing and updating flight data  
- SMS notifications for price drops using Twilio  
- Clean modular structure with separation of concerns (search, data handling, notifications)

Built for fun, automation practice, and hands-on experience with APIs.
